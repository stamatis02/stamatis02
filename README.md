# 👨‍💻 README.md

## Hi there, I’m Stamatis Psaros 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Piraeus (PAPEI), currently wrapping up the last few courses and getting deeper into building cool things with code.

I enjoy turning ideas into reality through software — especially when it involves the web, clean architecture, or solving real-world problems.
